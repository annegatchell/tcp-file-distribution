compile with make while in the main directory.

For servers, run in the main directory.
run server with:
.server <port> <server_ip>
eg. ./server 5555 128.138.201.66

For clients, move in the a client*/ folder and then use the following command.
run clients with:
./client <client name> <server ip> <server port#> <list of files> <this ip>

eg. ./client Anne 128.138.201.66 5555 client1/files_to_send.txt 128.138.201.67

You do need to list your own port number in these commands in order for the program to work
for some reason the self-setting option in get_addr_info was not working.


Status:
Clients are able to connect the the server via TCP. They are able to run the commands
listed above, and the server is able to interpret which command is run.
When a new client connects, the server announces their name to all the clients and 
sends a list of all the files on the server.

The List command works properly, but the format of the file list output is not
pretty, it is raw.

The SendMyFilesList command currently just resends the same list the client first sent.
For some reason, I cannot get the txt file with the file names to be re-read without a
segfault, so I just send the same list.
The server currently does not go through all the files and delete/add. It just
pushes a list of new files to all clients.

The Get <file> command is interpreted by the server, and the server sends the client the ip address of the owner of the file, or tells the client that they file is not
there.

The client receives the ip address of the owner of the file, and it connects to that ip address.
The client with the file accepts the connection, interprets and opens the file, and then sends
the file back. The other client receives the file and writes it to that file name.


Things that would be good to fix:
-If the same filename exists in the client's folder, it will be appened to.
-Max filesize is 1024 bytes. This could easily be fixed if I included the file size in the
list of files. I would dynamically allocate a buffer to send based on the files size.
Alas, I had to focus on the bigger issues at hand.
-The server should be updating the list of files.
-The server does not kick clients off after inactivity.
