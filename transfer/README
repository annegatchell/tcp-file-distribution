compile with make

run server with:
.server <port>
eg. ./server 5555

run clients with:
./client <client name> <server ip> <server port#> <list of files> <listen port>

eg. ./client Anne localhost 5555 client1/files_to_send.txt 6000

The reason I have a listen port entry is because when I am testing on my own machine,
I can't have multiple clients all bind to the same port.


Status:
Clients are able to connect the the server via TCP. They are able to run the commands
listed above, and the server is able to interpret which command is run.
When a new client connects, the server announces their name to all the clients and 
sends a list of all the files on the server.

The List command works properly, but the format of the file list output is not
pretty, it is raw.

The SendMyFilesList command currently just resends the same list the client first sent.
For some reason, I cannot get the txt file with the file names to be re-read without a
segfault, so I just send the same list.
The server currently does not go through all the files and delete/add. It just
pushes a list of new files to all clients.

The Get <file> command is interpreted by the server, and the server sends the client the ip address of the owner of the file, or tells the client that they file is not
there.

The client receives the ip address of the owner of the file, but does not yet connect to that owner to get the file.
